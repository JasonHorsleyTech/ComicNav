# Comic Nav

Simple JS to attach the right/left arrow keys to the Next and Previous comic buttons on _most_ sites.

## How to use

TODO: Break ComicNav.js out to it's src and it's minified versions, for better inclusion, then write up instructions

## Why?

I realized I've been reading Sam and Fuzzy for almost a decade now. I've been "arrowing down" to read the comic itself, then fussing with the stupid track pad on my laptop to hover over the "next comic" button. And that sucks.

So I reached out to the Author, thanked him for 10+ years of high quality free content, and asked if he would be willing to put a Javascript snippet on his site to save me the extra steps. And he said yes.

Was thinking this might apply to other sites, most have some queryable element for the next/prev actions. Will get Sam using, and then reach out to others who might be interested. Just for fun I guess? Just to get that much closer to the stars? Or more likely because my wife is on a girls trip to Vegas and I woke up Sunday morning realizing I have no hobbies.
